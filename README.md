# iced_coffee_project_prediction
The objectives of this analytical project stem from the need to better understand customer preferences and  behaviors within the Iced Coffee Packaged Brand study.
 By analyzing key attributes such as Coffee Type, Milk Type, Sugar %, Foam Thickness, and Flavor Additions, the project aims to uncover the relationships between 
these factors and customer satisfaction. Through exploratory data analysis, we seek to identify the distribution of satisfaction across various qualitative variables and pinpoint the numeric and ordinal variables that significantly influence satisfaction levels. 
Additionally, the project focuses on building predictive models to forecast customer satisfaction, churn, and the likelihood of repeat purchases, using the most relevant variables. By selecting and optimizing the best models, we aim to predict outcomes based on customer behavior patterns. Moreover, the project incorporates customer segmentation techniques to identify distinct customer clusters, enabling the creation of targeted strategies for different groups. Ultimately, the goal is to apply data-driven insights to improve product offerings and enhance customer retention strategies.
